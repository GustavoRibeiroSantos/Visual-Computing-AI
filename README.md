# Visual Computing Project: Real-time Person Detection with YOLOv3

## Overview
This project is a visual computing endeavor focused on developing a real-time person detection system using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3). The goal of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning and computer vision to analyze camera video streams and detect the presence of people within them. This README provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions for getting started.

## Introduction
Visual computing is an exciting field that combines computer vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret visual data. In this project, we have developed a real-time person detection system capable of identifying people in live camera video streams.

The project primarily utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the project.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful computer vision library for image and video processing.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental library for numerical computations in Python.
- **YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once)**: A state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that can detect a wide range of objects, including people.

## Project Components
The project is divided into several key components:

1. **Data Collection**: This project assumes the availability of a camera video feed as input. Ensure that you have access to a camera feed for real-time processing.

2. **YOLOv3 Model**: We use a pre-trained YOLOv3 model to detect people in the video stream. The YOLOv3 model is capable of detecting multiple objects simultaneously with high accuracy.

3. **Python Scripts**: We have developed Python scripts that use OpenCV and NumPy to capture video frames, process them using the YOLOv3 model, and draw bounding boxes around detected people.

4. **Results Visualization**: The project provides a way to visualize the real-time results, either by displaying the video feed with bounding boxes or saving the processed video to a file.

## Results
The project aims to provide real-time person detection in camera video streams. The results can be visualized through bounding boxes drawn around detected people in the video feed. Depending on your application, you can customize the output format and actions taken upon detection.

## Contributing
